# Testing Program: Statement of Work

## Summary/Purpose

Matthew Pogue, an instructor at WSU Tech, is hiring this company to develop a GUI application that will be able to let students take tests quickly and simply on a general campus computer. The software will take in a question bank that is made by the teacher and will allow the students to take the questions as an exam or practice for an exam. If the method is simple and popular enough, usage may extend to other teachers and can be used in the medical field.

## Functional Scope

Code will be properly stores on a Github project to allow the the instructor access to the software when it is needed. Once it is completed, there will be a clear folder that contains the software needed that can be downloaded to any campus computer and booted without any extra installation. There will also be a provided template in the Github that will allow the instructor to create their own question banks.

## Objectives

A `testTaker` program will be made that will take in a question bank in a `.csv` format. that is specifically formatted so that questions can be taken in either as multiple choice or short answer depending on what responses are available for the question. When the software is loaded with the question bank, there will be a `review questions` option and `take an exam` option. 

These are the following objectives that this program will achieve:
- Provide a simple format for a data bank (.csv file) for instructors to insert their own questions into
- Make a software that takes in questions from a data bank
- Provide two different interactible modes that can be selected
- Create an exam mode that will record the answers that the student chooses and provide a final score
- Create a review mode that will provide instant feedback on a student's answer

## Timeline
- **Feb 23, 2023** - Interview with Mr Matthew Pogue about the software he wishes to create.
- **Feb 28, 2023** - Statement of Work needs to be completed and sent to Mr Pogue to confirm details.
- **Mar 20, 2023** - Final product must be finished and submitted to Mr Pogue.

## Constraints
To receive the full compensation, Mr Pogue has listed some important constraints that must be followed when creating the program.

- The project must be finished on time in order to receive any compensation.
- The software must able to be used on campus computers without any installation.
- The software must be usable by other instructors if they provide their own questions.

## Compensation

Compensation from Mr Pogue will be in the form of a final letter grade that will shape the overall grade of the class. Once the final software has been sent in, the grade will be sent in accordance to the quality and degree of completion that was agreed upon.
