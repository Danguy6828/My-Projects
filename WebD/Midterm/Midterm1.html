                <h2>Home Page</h2>
                <p>These web pages are dedicated to dogs that I like and would be interested in when I am able to afford one in the future.
                    I do not know much about when it comes to raising dogs, so this is just a selection based on appearance.
                    It is possible that it may not be a good fit for my lifestyle, but this is just a start for me to research each dogs' temperament.</p>

                <h3>References</h3>
                <p>I will be doing research on the dogs and will link my sources in this section in the related page.</p>
