                <p>I unfortunately barely was in Japan on my way to Vietnam. When I arrived at Narita International Airport, I spent my entire 3 hours there exploring the airport to see what was offered.
                    It was a very large airport that had a wide variety of shops. I was unable to see everything that was there, even by power walking. I hope next time, I can actually explore Japan outside of its very large airport.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also something to note that the flight to Japan was definitely the longest I have ever been on a plane. Surprisingly for an 18 hour flight, it was the most comfortable flight I've been on.
                    American planes always give me serious motion sickness, but the Japanese plane did not get me sick at all. It also had some very nice meals provided.</p>
