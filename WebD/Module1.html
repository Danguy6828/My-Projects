<p style="color:gray;font-size:10px;"> This is where I post about me. Comic Sans should never be used professionally. </p>

<h2 style="font-size:40px;font-family:arial;"> Introduction </h2> <br>
<p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">Hi, my name is David Nguyen. I am a student at WSU Tech. I previously graduated from WSU's main campus and from Wichita East High School. My hobbies are playing games, watching anime, and self loathing. I do not have any pets, but I am hoping to have one in the future. </p>
